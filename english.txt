Singer: Avril Lavigne

Song name: Complicated

Lyrics:

Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
Chill out, what ya yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if, you could only let it be, you will see
I like you the way you are
When we're driving in your car
And you're talking to me one on one, but you become
Somebody else
'Round everyone else
You're watching your back
Like you can't relax
You try to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you faking
No, no, no
You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at you see
You're making me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know you're not fooling anyone
When you become
Somebody else
'Round everyone else
You're watching your back
Like you can't relax
You try to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you faking
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no (no, no)
Chill out, what ya yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see
Somebody else
'Round everyone else
You're watching your back
Like you can't relax
You try to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you faking
No, no
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get, and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you faking
No, no, no

Singer: Sting

Song name: Dessert Rose

Lyrics:





Ya leel
Ya leel
Hadaee mada tawila
Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti
Wa ana nahos ana wahala
Wa ana nahos ana wahala
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
These dreams that tie two hearts that will never die
Near the flames
The shadows play in the shape of the man's desire
This desert rose
Whose shadow bears the secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And now she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes
The rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of love
Ya leel
Ya leel
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
Sweet desert rose
Whose shadow bears the secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
This memory of hidden hearts and souls
This desert flower
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of love
Ya leel
Ya leel

Singer: Inna

Song name: India

Lyrics:



I hear you calling Inndia
Welcome to Inndia
We don't need nobody but Inndia
She's enough to make your body go wild
I can live my life here right now
It's a little bit scandalous
But she lives her life a little bit dangerous
Everybody in the club, can you handle us?
I can live my life here right now
Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move? Are you feeling naughty?
I'm gonna hypnotize you, are you ready for me?
And then you'll never say no, no, no
The sky is the limit, I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize and your mind off the time
Oh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no
I hear you calling Inndia
I hear you calling Inndia
Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move? Are you feeling naughty?
I'm gonna hypnotize you, are you ready for me?
And then you'll never say no, no, no
The sky is the limit, I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize and your mind off the time
Oh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no
I hear you calling Inndia
I hear you calling Inndia
Everybody stand up
I wanna see your hands up
I wanna see you move your body, girl don't stop
And if you're ballin'
Let me hear you callin'
'Cause we'll be at the after party, 'till the mornin'
Everybody stand up
I wanna see your hands up
I wanna see you move your body, girl don't stop
And if you're ballin'
Let me hear you callin'
'Cause we'll be at the after party, 'till the mornin'
Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move? Are you feeling naughty?
I'm gonna hypnotize you, are you ready for me?
And then you'll never say no, no, no
The sky is the limit, I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize and your mind off the time
Oh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no

Singer: REM

Song name: Losing my religion

Lyrics:


Oh life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot-light
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
Every whisper, of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up
Consider this
Consider this the hint of the century
Consider this the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spot-light
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, fly, try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream

Singer: Andy Williams

Song name: Yesterday

Lyrics:



There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing, another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you
There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams but how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you
There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams but how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you
